				<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Yes, there is a Teresa behind Teresa Caffé.  Born Teresa Azario in Bergamo, Italy, her youth took her to Brazil where she met Raul Momo Marmonti - "è stato un colpo di fulmine."  In 1960, and newlywed, our parents came to the United States and settled in the Bronx.</p>

					<p>Teresa always envisioned having her own caffé and her motivation was both romantic and practical:  our parents wanted all of their children to enjoy a better life and education and they worked tirelessly to make that happen. In the mid-1970s they opened a specialty food store – the very first Teresa Caffé.  Anyone who entered recognized Teresa's passion for life, devotion to fresh food, dedication to wholesome ingredients and an undying commitment to hospitality.</p>
